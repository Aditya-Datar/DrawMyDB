You are an expert in database design. Your ONLY job is to output a Mermaid ER diagram using erDiagram syntax.  ⚠️ Important rules:  Do not explain.  Do not add text before or after the diagram.  Only output the Mermaid code block.  Use the exact entities, attributes, and relationships I give you.  Mark primary keys with PK and foreign keys with FK.  Keep all entity names UPPERCASE.  Keep all attribute names as written.  Here is the full schema you must turn into Mermaid erDiagram code:  ENTITIES + ATTRIBUTES  PROFESSOR  PROF_NUM PK  PROF_SPECIALTY  PROF_RANK  PROF_LNAME  PROF_FNAME  PROF_INITIAL  PROF_EMAIL  SCHOOL  SCHOOL_CODE PK  SCHOOL_NAME  DEAN_PROF_NUM FK  DEPARTMENT  DEPT_CODE PK  DEPT_NAME  SCHOOL_CODE FK  CHAIR_PROF_NUM FK  COURSE  CRS_CODE PK  CRS_TITLE  CRS_DESCRIPTION  CRS_CREDIT  DEPT_CODE FK  SECTION  SEC_CODE PK  SEC_NUMBER  SEC_TIME  CRS_CODE FK  PROF_NUM FK  ROOM_CODE FK  STUDENT  STU_NUM PK  DEPT_CODE FK  STU_LNAME  STU_FNAME  STU_INITIAL  STU_EMAIL  ADVISOR_PROF_NUM FK  ENROLL  STU_NUM FK  SEC_CODE FK  ENROLL_DATE  ENROLL_GRADE  ROOM  ROOM_CODE PK  ROOM_TYPE  BLDG_CODE FK  BUILDING  BLDG_CODE PK  BLDG_NAME  BLDG_LOCATION  LIBRARY  LIB_ID PK  LIB_NAME  LIB_LOCATION  BOOK  BOOK_ID PK  TITLE  AUTHOR  ISBN  STATUS  LIB_ID FK  DORMITORY  DORM_ID PK  DORM_NAME  DORM_LOCATION  CAPACITY  CAFETERIA  CAFE_ID PK  CAFE_NAME  MENU_TYPE  LOCATION  BLDG_CODE FK  STAFF  STAFF_ID PK  STAFF_NAME  STAFF_ROLE  STAFF_EMAIL  DEPT_CODE FK  CAFE_ID FK  EVENT  EVENT_ID PK  EVENT_NAME  EVENT_DATE  EVENT_TYPE  BLDG_CODE FK  ORG_DEPT_CODE FK  RELATIONSHIPS  PROFESSOR advises STUDENT  PROFESSOR teaches SECTION  PROFESSOR chairs DEPARTMENT  PROFESSOR is employed by SCHOOL  SCHOOL operates DEPARTMENT  DEPARTMENT employs PROFESSOR  DEPARTMENT offers COURSE  COURSE generates SECTION  STUDENT enrolls in SECTION (via ENROLL)  SECTION is written in ENROLL  SECTION is held in ROOM  ROOM is found in BUILDING  BUILDING contains ROOM  LIBRARY manages BOOK  STUDENT borrows BOOK  PROFESSOR uses LIBRARY  STUDENT lives in DORMITORY  CAFETERIA serves STUDENT  CAFETERIA employs STAFF  STAFF works in DEPARTMENT  EVENT attended by STUDENT  EVENT attended by PROFESSOR  EVENT organized by DEPARTMENT  EVENT hosted in BUILDING  Final Instruction to LLM  Now output the ER diagram in exact Mermaid syntax, wrapped in:  ```mermaid erDiagram … ```  Do not add extra explanation.
